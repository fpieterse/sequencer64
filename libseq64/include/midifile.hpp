 *
 *  The Seq24 MIDI file is a standard, Format 1 MIDI file, with some extra
 *  "proprietary" tracks that hold information needed to set up the song
 *  in Seq24.
 *
 *  Sequencer64 can write out the Seq24 file with the "proprietary" tracks
 *  written in a format more palatable for strict MIDI programs, such as
 *  midicvt (a MIDI-to-ASCII conversion program available at the
 *  https://github.com/ahlstromcj/midicvt.git repository.
 *
 *  Sequencer64 can also split an SMF 0 file into multiple tracks, effectively
 *  converting it to SMF 1.
