/**
 *  A new type to support the concept of sequence color.  This feature cannot
 *  be used in the current versions of Sequencer64, because their color is
 *  determined by the font bitmap.  The color will be a number pointing to an
 *  RGB entry in a palette.  A future feature, we're making room for it here.
 *
 *  This enumeration provide as stock palette of colors.  For example,
 *  Kepler34 creates a color-map in this manner:
 *
 *      extern QMap<thumb_colours_e, QColor> colourMap;
 *
 *  Of course, we would use std::map instead of QMap, and include a wrapper
 *  class to keep QColor unexposed to non-Qt entities.  Also, we define the
 *  colors in standard X-terminal order, not in Kepler34 order.
