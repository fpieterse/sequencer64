 *
 *  Provides a function to make it easy to run an application as a (Linux)
 *  daemon.  There are large differences between POSIX daemons and Win32
 *  services.  Thus, this module is currently Linux-specific.
 *
 *  The quick-and-dirty story on creating a daemon.
 *
 *      -#  Fork off the parent process.
 *      -#  Change file mode mask (umask)
 *      -#  Open any logs for writing.
 *      -#  Create a unique Session ID (SID)
 *      -#  Change the current working directory to a safe place.
 *      -#  Close standard file descriptors.
 *      -#  Enter actual daemon code.
 *
 *  This module handles all of the above.  Things not yet handled:
 *
 *      -#  Generation of various helpful files:
 *          -   PID file
 *          -   Lock file
 *          -   Error and information output file (though we do log some
 *              information via the syslog).
 *      -#  Thorough setting of the environment.
 *      -#  Thorough handling of user IDs and groups.
 *      -#  Redirection of the standard outputs to files.
 *
 *  See this project for an application that does all of the above:
 *
 *      https://github.com/bmc/daemonize
 *
 * \todo
 *      There is a service wrapper available under Win32.  It is called
 *      "srvhost.exe".  At this time, we *still* don't know how to use it, but
 *      it is available, and Windows XP seems to use it quite a bit.

 *      http://www.deez.info/sengelha/projects/sigrandd/doc/#5.           <br>
 *
 *      -# Fork off the parent process.
 *      -# Change file mode mask (umask).
 *      -# Open the system log for writing (optional).
 *      -# Create a unique Session ID (SID).
 *      -# Open any logs for writing.
 *      -# Change the current working directory to a safe place.
 *      -# Close standard file descriptors.
 *      -# Enter actual daemon code.
 *      -# Close the log upon exiting the daemon.
 *
 * \algorithm
 *  -# Fork an identical child process.  After the fork() call, we now
 *     have a copy of this application running as a child process.  We can
 *     then kill off the parent process using exit().  The child inherits
 *     the process group ID of the parent but gets a new process ID, so
 *     we're guaranteed that the child is not a process group leader. This
 *     is a prerequisite for the call to setsid() that is done later.
 *  -# Once this succeeds, we want to change the file-mode mask so that
 *     the daemon has access to system files that it creates.  The file
 *     mode creation mask that's inherited could have been set to deny
 *     certain permissions.
 *  -# Optional:  Open the system log for writing.  We make
 *     the system log our error-log, using the set_syslogging()
 *     function of the errorlogging.c module.
 *  -# The child process must get a unique SID (session ID) from the
 *     kernel in order to operate.  Otherwise, the child process becomes
 *     an orphan in the system. The pid_t type is used for the new SID.
 *     The process becomes a session leader of a new session, becomes the
 *     process group leader of a new process group, and has no controlling
 *     terminal.
 *  -# The current working directory should be changed to some place that
 *     is guaranteed to always be there. Since many Linux distributions do
 *     not completely follow the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy standard, the
 *     only directory that is guaranteed to be there is the root (/).
 *     However, we make it a command-line option that defaults to ".".
 *     See the functions in the audio_arguments.c/h module.
 *     Since daemons normally exist until the system is rebooted, if the
 *     daemon stays on a mounted filesystem, that filesystem cannot be
 *     unmounted.
 *  -# An important step in setting up a daemon is closing out the
 *     standard file descriptors (STDIN, STDOUT, STDERR). Since a daemon
 *     cannot use the terminal, these file descriptors are useless, and a
 *     potential security hazard.
 *  -# As the last step, we check out the command-line arguments and the
 *     audio parameters, and use them to start the desired task.
 *  -# If the server is stopped normally, we go ahead and call closelog(),
 *     even though it is optional.
 *
