 *      differently for parsing (reading) versus writing the MIDI file.
 *      -   Reading.
 *          -   If set to SEQ64_USE_DEFAULT_PPQN, the legacy application
 *              behavior is used.  The m_ppqn member is set to the default
 *              PPQN, DEFAULT_PPQN.  The value read from the MIDI
 *              file, ppqn, is then use to scale the running-time of the
 *              sequence relative to DEFAULT_PPQN.
 *          -   Otherwise, m_ppqn is set to the value read from the MIDI file.
 *              No scaling is done.  Since the value gets written, specify
 *              ppqn as 0, an obviously bogus value, to get this behavior.
 *      -   Writing.  This value is written to the MIDI file in the header
 *          chunk of the song.  Note that the caller must query for the
 *          PPQN set during parsing, and pass it to the constructor when
 *          preparing to write the file.  See how it is done in the mainwnd
 *          class.

/**
 *  This function splits the given sequence into a new sequence, for the given

 *  resulting in multiple passes over the SMF 0 track.
 *
 *  Note that the events that are read from the MIDI file have delta times.
 *  Sequencer64 converts these delta times to cumulative times.    We
 *  need to preserve that here.  Conversion back to delta times is needed only
 *  when saving the sequences to a file.  This is done in
 *  midi_container::fill().
 *
 *  We have to accumulate the delta times in order to be able to set the
 *  length of the sequence in pulses.
 *
 *  Luckily, we don't have to worry about copying triggers, since the imported
 *  SMF 0 track won't have any Seq24/Sequencer24 triggers.
 *
 *  It doesn't set the sequence number of the sequence; that is set when the
 *  sequence is added to the perform object.
 *
 * \param main_seq
 *      This parameter is the whole SMF 0 track that was read from the MIDI
 *      file.  It contains all of the channel data that needs to be split into
 *      separate sequences.
 *
 * \param s
 *      Provides the new sequence that needs to have its settings made, and
 *      all of the selected channel events added to it.
 *
 * \param channel
 *      Provides the MIDI channel number (re 0) that marks the channel data
 *      the needs to be extracted and added to the new sequence.  If this
 *      channel is 0, then we need to add certain Meta events to this
 *      sequence, as well.  So far we support only Tempo Meta events.
 *
 * \return
 *      Returns true if at least one event got added.   If none were added,
