 *
 *  The "time" window is the horizontal bar at the upper right of the main
 *  window, just to the left of the "L" button.  This bar shows one or
 *  more black "pills" that show that the tune is progressing, both for beats
 *  and for measures. The beats are also shown as a flashing that occurs on
 *  each beat as playback occurs.
 *
 *  We've also added some member variables that represent calculations
 *  involving constants, which need be performed only once.  Save CPU time at
 *  the expense of a little memory.
