\section seq64_notes_intro Introduction

<i>Sequencer64</i> is a major cleanup, refactoring, and documentation of the
<i>Seq24</i> live-play MIDI sequencer.

The current document, generated by Doxygen, describes the approaches and issues
for various problems we have solved in <i>Sequencer64</i>.

Also read the ROADMAP, README, and contrib/bugs_to_investigate  files to
understand the genesis of this project and the things that still need to be
done with Sequencer64.

Also, we have pretty deeply documented <i>Seq24</i> and <i>Sequencer64</i>
with PDF files that can be
generated by git-cloning the following projects, installing a number of tools
related to PDF and LaTeX, and running "make":

   -  https://github.com/ahlstromcj/seq24-doc.git
   -  https://github.com/ahlstromcj/sequencer64-doc.git

These project also have prebuilt PDFs should one not want to bother building
them.
