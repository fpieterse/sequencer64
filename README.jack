This README file provides the things you need to know to run
the new native JACK implmentation of sequencer64, an executable called seq64.
The first thing to note about seq64 is that it supports both ALSA and JACK
MIDI.  If you run it to support JACK, and JACK is not present, then seq64
falls back to ALSA support.

To run seq64 to support JACK, for now, one must add the "-t" or "--jack-midi"
option.  Why "-t"?  We are running out of option letters.

The next thing to note about seq64 is that the original JACK-transport options
are still present, but the JACK-transport support is *separate* from the
JACK-MIDI support.  The JACK-transport client is an invisible client with the
name "seq64-transport", while the JACK-MIDI client is visible in QJackCtl, and
is named "seq64".

To enable the JACK transport support, the options -j/--jack-transport,
-J/--jack-master, and -C/--jack-master-cond are available.

To enable the JACK MIDI support, the -t/--jack-midi options are available.
When enabled, the "transport" button in the main window will show the word
"Native" (even when JACK transport is also enabled).  Please note that, if you
select the jack-midi option and JACK is not available, seq64 will start in
ALSA mode and save that mode when exiting.  The JACK options are sticky
options.  That is, they are saved to the "rc" configuration file, so one does
not have to specify them in subsequent seq64 sessions.

The manual-versus-normal port support for JACK MIDI is essentially the same as
that for ALSA.  The -m/--manual-alsa-ports option actually provides what are
known as "virtual" ports.  These are ports that do not represent hardware, but
are created by applications to allow them to connect to other applications or
MIDI devices.

The different between manual/virtual ports and normal ports is that, while
normal ports are automatically connected to the remote ports that exist in the
system, while the manual/virtual ports are just created, and one must manually
connect them via, for example, the QJackCtl connections dialog.

So, if you want seq64 to automatically connect to all existing JACK MIDI
ports, do not use the -m/--manual-alsa-ports option... use the
-a/--auto-alsa-ports option.  Both options apply to both ALSA and JACK, but we
do not want to change the options names yet.

If you want the freedom to make the connections yourself, or with a session
manager, use the manual/virtual option.

One thing fixed in the new version is the ability to store MIDI note-on events
with the actual velocity provided by the MIDI keyboard used to generate the
notes.  Previously, even in seq24, the "Free" "Vol" option did not work.  this
is fixed.

Also, do not forget the "step" option.  If one paints notes with the mouse, the
note is previewed, and the note position advances with each click.  If one
paints notes via an external MIDI keyboard, the notes are painted and
advanced, but they are not previewed.  To preview them, click the "pass MIDI
in to output" button to activate it so that they will be passed to your sound
generator.
