The system settings are shown by the following command, with Yoshimi
running, an audio USB port, a MIDI USB port, and a Korg nanoKEY2 USB
keyboard plugged in.
 
$ aplaymidi -l
 Port    Client name                      Port name
 14:0    Midi Through                     Midi Through Port-0
 28:0    E-MU XMidi1X1 Tab                E-MU XMidi1X1 Tab MIDI 1
 32:0    nanoKEY2                         nanoKEY2 MIDI 1
128:0    TiMidity                         TiMidity port 0
128:1    TiMidity                         TiMidity port 1
128:2    TiMidity                         TiMidity port 2
128:3    TiMidity                         TiMidity port 3
129:0    'yoshimi'                       'input           '
 
Note that yoshimi does NOT show up in this list, so we put it there.
 
Not sure if it is useful to include the Thru port, but okay.
Also, I am assuming the default timidity setup is GM-compliant.
Finally, there is a lot that can be set up with Yoshimi, even ignoring
the changes that can be wrought by loading a different *.xmz file
into Yoshimi.

# 1. Define your instruments and their control-code names,
#    if they have them.
# 2. Define a MIDI bus, its name, and what instruments are
#    on which channel.
#
# In the following MIDI buss definitions, channels are counted
# from 0 to 15, not 1 to 16.  Instruments not set here are set to
# -1 (SEQ64_GM_INSTRUMENT_FLAG) and are GM (General MIDI).
# These replacement MIDI buss labels are shown in MIDI Clocks,
# MIDI Inputs, and in the Pattern Editor buss drop-down.

# ======== Sequencer64-Specific Variables Section ========

[user-interface-settings]

# These settings specify the modifiable configuration
# of some of the Sequencer64 user-interface elements.

# Specifies the style of the main-window grid of patterns.
#
# 0 = Normal style, matches the GTK theme, has brackets.
# 1 = White grid boxes that have brackets.
# 2 = Black grid boxes (no brackets, our favorite).

2       # grid_style

# Specifies box style of an empty slot in the main-window grid.
#
# 0  = Draw a one-pixel box outline around the pattern slot.
# 1  = Draw brackets on the sides of the pattern slot.
# 2 to 30 = Make the brackets thicker and thicker.
# -1 = Same as 0, draw a box outline one-pixel thick.
# -2 to -30 = Draw a box outline, thicker and thicker.

2       # grid_brackets

# Specifies the number of rows in the main window.
# Values of 4 (the default) through 8 (the best alternative value)
# are allowed.

4       # mainwnd_rows

# Specifies the number of columns in the main window.
# At present, values from 8 (the default) to 12 are supported.

8       # mainwnd_cols

# Specifies the maximum number of sets, which defaults to 32.
# It is currently never necessary to change this value. In fact,
# it should be a derived value.

32      # max_sets

# Specifies the border width in the main window.

0      # mainwid_border

# Specifies the border spacing in the main window.

2      # mainwid_spacing

# Specifies a quantity that affect the height of the main window.

0      # control_height

# Specifies the initial zoom for the piano rolls.  Ranges from 1.
# to 512 (the legacy maximum was 32), and defaults to 2 unless
# changed here.  Note that large PPQN values will require larger
# zoom values in order to look good in the sequence editor.
# Sequencer64 adapts the zoom to the PPQN, if zoom is set to 0.

2      # default zoom (0 = auto-adjust to PPQN)

# Specifies if the key, scale, and background sequence are to be
# applied to all sequences, or to individual sequences.  The
# behavior of Seq24 was to apply them to all sequences.  But
# Sequencer64 takes it further by applying it immediately, and
# by saving to the end of the MIDI file.  Note that these three
# values are stored in the MIDI file, not this configuration file.
# Also note that reading MIDI files not created with this feature
# will pick up this feature if active, and the file gets saved.
# It is contagious.
#
# 0 = Allow each sequence to have its own key/scale/background.
#     Settings are saved with each sequence.
# 1 = Apply these settings globally (similar to seq24).
#     Settings are saved in the global final section of the file.

1      # global_seq_feature

# Specifies if the old, console-style font, or the new anti-
# aliased font, is to be used as the font throughout the GUI.
# In legacy mode, the old font is the default.
#
# 0 = Use the old-style font.
# 1 = Use the new-style font.

1      # use_new_font

# Specifies if the user-interface will support two song editor
# windows being shown at the same time.  This makes it easier to
# edit songs with a large number of sequences.
#
# 0 = Allow only one song editor (performance editor).
# 1 = Allow two song editors.

1      # allow_two_perfedits

# Specifies the number of 4-measure blocks for horizontal page
# scrolling in the song editor.  The old default, 1, is a bit
# small.  The new default is 4.  The legal range is 1 to 6, where
# 6 is the width of the whole performance piano roll view.

4      # perf_h_page_increment

# Specifies the number of 1-track blocks for vertical page
# scrolling in the song editor.  The old default, 1, is a bit
# small.  The new default is 8.  The legal range is 1 to 18, where
# 18 is about the height of the whole performance piano roll view.

8      # perf_v_page_increment

# Specifies if the progress bar is colored black, or a different
# color.  The following integer color values are supported:
# 
# 0 = black
# 1 = dark red
# 2 = dark green
# 3 = dark orange
# 4 = dark blue
# 5 = dark magenta
# 6 = dark cyan

0      # progress_bar_colored

# Specifies if the progress bar is thicker.  The default is 1
# pixel.  The 'thick' value is 2 pixels.  (More than that is not
# useful.  Set this value to 1 to enable the feature, 0 to disable
# it.

1      # progress_bar_thick

# Specifies using an alternate (darker) color palette.  The
# default is the normal palette.  Not all items in the user
# interface are altered by this setting, and it's not perfect.
# Set this value to 1 to enable the feature, 0 to disable it.

0      # inverse_colors

# Specifies the window redraw rate for all windows that support
# that concept.  The default is 40 ms.  Some windows used 25 ms.

40      # window_redraw_rate

# Specifies using icons for some of the user-interface buttons
# instead of text buttons.  This is purely a preference setting.
# If 0, text is used in some buttons (the main window buttons).
# Otherwise, icons are used.  One will have to experiment :-).

0      # use_more_icons (currently affects only main window)

# Specifies the number of set window ('wid') rows to show.
# The long-standing default is 1, but 2 or 3 may also be set.
# Corresponds to 'r' in the '-o wid=rxc,f' option.

1      # block_rows (number of rows of set blocks/wids)

# Specifies the number of set window ('wid') columns to show.
# The long-standing default is 1, but 2 may also be set.
# Corresponds to 'c' in the '-o wid=rxc,f' option.

1      # block_columns (number of columns of set blocks/wids)

# Specifies if the multiple set windows are 'in sync' or can
# be set to arbitrary set numbers independently.
# The default is false (0), means that there is a single set
# spinner, which controls the set number of the upper-left 'wid',
# and the rest of the set numbers follow sequentially.  If true
# (1), then each 'wid' can be set to any set-number.
# Corresponds to the 'f' (true, false, or 'indep') in the
# '-o wid=rxc,f' option.  Here, 1 is the same as 'indep' or false,
# and 0 is the same as f = true.  Backwards, so be careful.

0      # block_independent (set spinners for each block/wid)

[user-midi-settings]

# These settings specify MIDI-specific value that might be
# better off as variables, rather than constants.

# Specifies parts-per-quarter note to use, if the MIDI file.
# does not override it.  Default is 192, but we'd like to go
# higher than that.

192       # midi_ppqn

# Specifies the default beats per measure, or beats per bar.
# The default value is 4.

4       # midi_beats_per_measure/bar

# Specifies the default beats per minute.  The default value
# is 120, and the legal range is 20 to 600. Also see the value of
# midi_bpm_minimum and midi_bpm_maximum below.

120       # midi_beats_per_minute

# Specifies the default beat width. The default value is 4.

4       # midi_beat_width

# Specifies the buss-number override, the same as the --bus
# command-line option. The default value is -1, which means that
# there is no buss override.  If a value from 0 to 31 is given,
# then that buss value overrides all buss values in all patterns.
# Change this value from -1 only to use a single output buss,
# either for testing or convenience.  And don't save the MIDI file
# afterwards, unless you want to overwrite all the buss values!

0       # midi_buss_override (enabled, careful!)

# Specifies the default velocity override when adding notes in the
# sequence/pattern editor.  This value is obtained via the 'Vol'
# button, and ranges from 0 (not recommended :-) to 127.  If the
# value is -1, then the incoming note velocity is preserved.

80       # velocity_override (-1 = 'Free')

# Specifies the precision of the beats-per-minutes spinner and
# MIDI control over the BPM value.  The default is 0, which means
# the BPM is an integer.  Other values are 1 and 2 decimal digits
# of precision.

1       # bpm_precision

# Specifies the step increment of the beats/minute spinner and
# MIDI control over the BPM value.  The default is 1. For a
# precision of 1 decimal point, 0.1 is a good value.  For a
# precision of 2 decimal points, 0.01 is a good value, but one
# might want somethings a little faster, like 0.05.

1       # bpm_step_increment

# Specifies the page increment of the beats/minute field. It is
# used when the Page-Up/Page-Down keys are pressed while the BPM
# field has the keyboard focus.  The default value is 10.

10       # bpm_page_increment

# Specifies the minimum value of beats/minute in tempo graphing.
# By default, the tempo graph ranges from 0.0 to 127.0.
# This value can be increased to give a magnified view of tempo.

0       # midi_bpm_minimum

# Specifies the maximum value of beats/minute in tempo graphing.
# By default, the tempo graph ranges from 0.0 to 127.0.
# This value can be increased to give a magnified view of tempo.

127       # midi_bpm_maximum

[user-options]

# These settings specify application-specific values that are
# set via the -o or --option switch, which help expand the number
# of options the Sequencer64 options can support.

# The daemonize option is used in seq64cli to indicate that the
# application should be gracefully run as a service.

0       # option_daemonize

# This value specifies an optional log-file that replaces output
# to standard output and standard error.  To indicate no log-file,
# the string "" is used.  Currently, this option works best from
# the command line, as in '-o log=filename.log'.
